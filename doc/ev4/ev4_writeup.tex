Our resource management tool is a web application that uses the following technology stack: a React.js frontend, a Java Spring server, and a PostgreSQL database. In addition, we use Python scripts to automate the testing of our API. Our overall technology stack, as well as our overall code structure, have not changed since evolution 3. 

TODO: UPDATE FOR EV 4
The changes required for evolution 3 fit nicely into our existing frameworks. In the backend, resource manager permissions were handled with a few new API calls built on top of our evolution 2 permission API calls. Additionally, the email service was expanded to accomodate the new set of email requirements. Finally, the necesarry changes were made across existing reservation endpoints to support multiple resources within each reservation, and corresponding DB updates were made as well. The primary changes on the front-end are to add text boxes for the new reservation fields, a checkbox for restricted resources, and a new tab for approvable reservations.

\section{Backend}

\label{sec:Backend}
The backend consists of the parts of the software system that run on a VPS (Virtual Private Server) using Ubuntu Linux 14.04. Our software uses PostgreSQL 9.5 for persistent data storage and the Java Spring Framework as the container for a Tomcat web server. If the backend were viewed as an MVC (Model-View-Controller), PostgreSQL would be the model and Java Spring would be the view (REST API) and the controller (request processing, database communication, and response creation). 

This architecture has not changed since evolution 1, and it has suited us well. 

\subsection{Java and Java Spring}
Java and Java Spring have continued to suit us well in evolution 4. Java's clear syntax and static typing make it easy for us to work on each other's code, and Spring has continued to be very easy to add new REST endpoints to. 

Given that over all four evolutions, we have yet to encounter any major issues that another language or backend framework would have solved much more easily, we are overall quite happy with our choice of backend architecture. 

TODO: Anything else?



\subsection{PostgreSQL}
\subsubsection{Retrospective}
PostgreSQL served us well for evolution 4. Notably, evolution 4 required very few DB changes, meaning that the primary downside of using a structured database (dealing with DB schema updates and modifications) was not apparent during evolution 4. Furthermore, we still feel that the clarity and structure imposed by a SQL database has helped our team understand how we intend to store and manipulate data in each evolution, making mis-communication less likely. 

Because evolution 4 did not require significant modifications to how the DB is accessed, we have still not had any need to use advanced SQL DB techniques, and thus it is unlikely that any other SQL database would have provided more useful tools for us than PostreSQL. 


\subsubsection{Current Design}
The following changes were made to our DB schema for evolution 4:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item A 'shared_count' (int) field and a 'parent_id' (int) field were added to the 'resources' table. 
    \item TODO: Anything else?? 
\end{enumerate}

You can see a full diagram of this updated schema in  \hyperref[appendix:DBDesign]{Appendix \ref{appendix:DBDesign}}. 

\subsection{Security}
\subsubsection{Retrospective}
Previous security design decisions did not affect our work for evolution 4 very much. Our decision to use our own authorization tokens over Duke's OAuth tokens has led to no undesired consequences, and code related to authentication and login has not needed to be altered or extended at all. 

Otherwise, in evolution 3 we made an additional effort to always validate data requests before any DB accesses are performed. This has not really altered our work for evolution 4, but it has helped us ensure that no unintended bugs can occur due to unexpected data being input on the frontend. 

TODO: Anything else? 


\subsection{Testing}

TODO: What to write for evolution 4? 

\subsubsection{Retrospective}
Our python testing suite has continued to suit us well for testing our REST API. That being said, as this project has become more and more complex, the number of tests required has grown somewhat exponentially. This has made it hard to keep up our testing suit with our actual code changes. However, this problem is more related to the project's complexity itself, rather than our testing design. The simple fact of the matter is that, no matter how we implemented testing, it would become harder and harder to maintain a full suite of tests on the REST API. 

Another small issue with our current testing plan relates to the fact that many of the requirements on each new evolution force us to make changes to the way previous API endpoints were built, such as changing what data structures are returned, etc. The problem with this is that our current testing assertions are completely literal, and test for a precisely identical JSON response. This means that if a given test ran correctly, but then we add a single extra field to the JSON response of the API endpoint being tested, the test will now be broken. Perhaps some other testing frameworks would allow our tests to be a little more flexible with what they received. This would prevent so many of our tests from immediately breaking after a few basic changes are made for a new evolution. 

\subsubsection{Current Design}
Despite the above challenges, on the whole, we are still happy with our current backend testing strategy. Python tests are easy to run, easy to modify, and easy to create. And, we still stand by our decision to focus our testing on the REST API, rather than on unit tests, since the REST API is the ultimate thing that the front-end cares about. Moving forward, we will need to make sure that we add enough tests to accomodate all of the evolution 4 features, even if that means adding an immense number of tests. 


\subsection{Code Structure}
Nothing substantial has changed in regards to our overall code architecture or structure. Backend changes for evolution 4 almost entirely involved modifying existing resource service methods and modifying existing reservation service methods, and as such virtually no higher level code layout changes were required. We are still appreciative of our MVC layout and how our packages are divided based on modules (like reservation module, resource module, etc) as it made it quite easy to know where to make changes for resource and reservation changes in evolution 4. 

TODO: Anythinge else?


\subsection{Reservations}
TODO: Jiawei do we want to keep this for evolution 4? 
\subsubsection{Retrospective}
Our existing reservations code went through a few changes to accommodate reservation titles, descriptions, and multiple resources. All the reservations code was also refactored to better accommodate future changes to reservations. 

\subsubsection{Current Design}
Adding titles and descriptions to reservations was trivial, as there was a one-to-one mapping from reservation\_id to title and description. Adding multiple resources to reservations was more difficult and involved checking permissions for each resource before associating the resource to a reservation. Finally, once the resource permissions are handled, if the resources are restricted, they are sent off to be approved by those with approval permission. There are edge cases such as reservations with no resources or reservations with all unrestricted resources (which would require no approval) which involve automatically setting the status of a reservation to complete. 

Overall, the additions to reservations were very simply implemented. Reservations code was then completely refactored to stop using a deprecated JDBC class and start using the new JdbcTemplate class, which provides additional security features and is much simpler to use. 

\subsection{Email}
\subsection{Retrospective}
No specific email requirements changed for evolution 4, and as a result we did not have to make any modifications or updates to email-related classes or code. Notably, we feel that our email design frome evolution 3 was done well, as it created a very clean email API for specific events (reservation canceled, reservation starting, etc). The result of this was that, although evolution 4 required a number of changes to reservation code and pending reservation code, these changes could be totally separate from having to modify the email code, even though these features are closely related. 

In this sense, the changes we made in evolution 3 in regards to email were very beneficial. We decoupled email from other modules of code as much as possible, and the result was extreme ease in modifying code related to email, without having to worry that it would mess up our emailing system. 

\subsection{Current Design}
Since no explicit email changes were needed for evolution 4, there were no new email design decisions made. 


\subsection{Permissions}
TODO: What to write for evolution 4? 
\subsubsection{Retrospective And Current Design}
The permissions design we implemented for evolution 2 had two key factors:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Storing resource-specific permissions as a single integer value (no access as 0, view access as 1, reserve access as 2), rather than as separate boolean values or values stored in separate DB tables. 
    \item Having all permission modification and viewing being done through a single permission matrix. 
\end{enumerate}

These design choices have proven to be very helpful. First of all, as we argued in our evolution 2 document, the choice to have all permissions be in a single place (the permission matrix) has made using and testing our system exceptionally easy. As we add new features and need to manually test them, we can trivially edit the permissions in the system to create the test scenario that we want to create. Had we separated out user permissions and group permissions or resource permissions and system permissions, it would have substantially slowed our manual testing and general usage of our application. 

Secondly, and more importantly, these design choices made it very easy to handle the new permission requirements for evolution 3. Evolution 3's major permission change is that there are now "resource managers". Our design enabled us to just define the standard that resource manager is represented by a value of 3 in our resource-specific permission tables. In other words, nothing in the backend had to change to handle resource managers being shown in the permission matrix or to handle resource managers being set via the permission matrix. 

In addition, new backend methods to retrieve resource managers (for the new incomplete reservation endpoints) were able to re-use much of our previous permission code, since detecting of resource managers involves all the same DB calls, but is simply checking for a different integer. 

As such, we feel that our argument in the evolution 2 doc that our permission design allowed the easy addition of new permissions has been shown as very true. Furthermore, we believe that if evolution 4 brings on even more permission variations, we should be able to easily accomodate those as well.

\subsubsection{Assumptions}
TODO: What to write for evolution 4? 

Given the ambiguity of some evolution requirements, here are some of the assumptions we made this evolution:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item W
\end{enumerate}


\section{REST API}
\label{sec:REST}
Communication between the frontend and the backend is done through a REST API with JSON (\hyperref[appendix:apispec]{Appendix \ref{appendix:apispec}}).

\subsection{Retrospective}
The JSON-based REST API served us well for Evolution 3. We identified several strengths that helped us implement the new set of requirements: the well-understood nature of JSON and the fairly rich state transfer afforded to us. Furthermore, the weaknesses we identified (that the client must initiate all data transfer and JSON's rigid tree-of-values structure) did not affect us much when we implemented Evolution 3.

\subsection{Current Design}
We expanded the set of endpoints that were required to implement the requirements in Evolution 3. Adding the title and description fields to reservations was a trivial change to the API. From an API perspective, compound reservations involved changing the type of the field from an integer to a list of integers. (This is not to say that the backend changes to implement this feature were as simple). Restricted resources are handled with one extra Boolean field on resources. Resource managers were added as a higher level to the permissions endpoints.

\section{Frontend}
\label{sec:Frontend}
The frontend consists of the parts of the software system that are transferred to the user's computer and are run in the user's browser. The officially supported browser is the latest version of Google Chrome, but other modern browsers should work as well. We use the third-party libraries React.js, Bootstrap, and JQuery, but React.js has the most implications for the code design.

\subsection{React.js}
\subsubsection{Retrospective}
The frontend is written in React.js, a library written at Facebook for building user interfaces (UIs). We have been pleased with React.js. Our only complaint has been that React.js has occasionally required somewhat large amounts of boilerplate. We have read online that this boilerplate can be significantly reduced with some more advanced React.js techniques like mix-ins. We plan to take advantage of this in future React.js projects, but for now the cost of updating the code to use mix-ins would be higher than the benefit of more concise code.

As we discussed in our Evolution 1 writeup, using React.js allows us to trivially avoid inconsistent UIs, since the view is re-rendered from the whole state. As expected, we did not encounter a single UI bug due displaying inconsistent data.

\subsubsection{Current Design}
We made no changes to our usage of React.js, as we were quite pleased with it.

\subsection{React components}
\subsubsection{Retrospective}
Within the React framework, we designed components to express the desired UI in a natural way. At the top level of the HTML body is a Router component. This Router's state includes a route and other state to mediate communication between views. The route is a string that indicates which part of the application the user is in (e.g. ``reservation\_list'').

The Router, depending on its route state, will render another component (e.g. Login, AdminConsole, ReservationList, GroupManager). All of these views are themselves just HTML renderings of their state. Each of these subcomponents contains their own state. We considered having a global datastore of resources and reservations, but decided that the simplest way to maintain correctness across views was to simply redownload the data each time.

This design served us well. One minor issue we encountered was related to sending information between components. Because the components rendered by the Router do not have knowledge about each other, they must send information through the Router, which then passes the information as a 'prop' to the receiving subcomponent. Though this has worked well in practice, it does seem a bit unwieldy. In fact, this limitation of our design affected us during implementation of evolution 3. To satisfy requirement 2(e) ("allow the user to create a new reservation with the same resources as their previous reservation"), we needed to send some information from the reservation editor to the reservation creator. This amount of state, though not particularly large, continues to pollute the state of our parent Router component. We may consider a refactor before implementing evolution 4 if, in our judgment, we will be sending a lot more state between subcomponents through the Router parent component.

\subsubsection{Current Design}
For the new requirements in Evolution 3, we did not add any subcomponents to our React hierarchy. Instead, we changed the reservation creator and editor to allow multiple resources, the resource creator and editor to have a checkbox for restricted status, and the permissions manager to have an additional level for resource managers. All of these changes were only in the UI and did not reveal significant technical debt.

\subsection{Testing}
\subsubsection{Retrospective}
For frontend testing, we decided to write a test plan (\hyperref[appendix:frontendtest]{Appendix \ref{appendix:frontendtest}}) that is intended to be performed manually. Testers can load the application and execute actions that are intended to exercise most of the code paths in the application. This manual testing has the advantage that it has a low upfront cost and it is easy to implement. The disadvantage is that it is slow and takes a lot of human time and energy.

One alternative is to perform automated UI testing. We are aware of two different types automated UI testing: 1) programmatic access to the application and 2) simulation of mouse/keyboard events and screenshots. We decided against 1) because the UI is still in an infantile stage, and the intended DOM changes quite frequently. We decided that programmatically testing for the presence of, say, a certain <div> tag would be prohibitively expensive. We decided against 2) for the same reason that the intended DOM changes quite frequently, but also because we decided that such an approach seemed very fragile.

We were very pleased with our decision not to implement automated UI testing. While we did encounter some UI bugs, these bugs did not take long enough to catch that they would have justified the significant cost of implementing automated UI testing. (It's important to note that automated UI testing only decreases the amount of time it takes to catch bugs, not the amount of time it takes to fix them, a process which is more properly called \emph{debugging}.)

\subsubsection{Current Design}
As a result of our success with the manual UI testing from evolution 1, the only changes to our methodology here are to increase the number of test cases to account for the new functionality introduced by the Evolution 3 requirements.
